    -   A modern, component-based migration using **React** and **Vite**.
    -   Features smooth animations, theme toggling, and modular components.
    -   Optimized for deployment with `netlify.toml` in the root.

2.  **Static Version** (Root Directory)
    -   The original legacy version built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.
